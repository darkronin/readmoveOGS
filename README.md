# readmoveOGS
scripts for playing on OGS to aid the visually impaired

These bookmarklets take inspiration from this post: https://github.com/online-go/online-go.com/issues/1366#issuecomment-2317751287 and add text-to-speech functionality.

I prepared two versions of the script. One in English, one in Japanese.
They have been tested on real-time games only.

English version: readmove.js - Read aloud move coordinates in English. Example "New move: K 10"

Japanese version: readmoveJP.js - Read aloud moves in Japanese. Example “手、10、10”
